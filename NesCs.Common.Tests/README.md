## Testing utilities

This project includes the Json deserializer to load the scenarios from Tom Harte's [Processor Tests](https://github.com/TomHarte/ProcessorTests/tree/main/nes6502) directly into the tests, saving precious time with convertions. It also includes some extra test utilities as a spy to check the cycles and a factory to create the subject under test.
